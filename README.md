# AI Assistant for Data Science ðŸ¤–

## Overview

This Streamlit web application serves as an AI Assistant for Data Science projects. It guides users through the initial steps of data analysis and exploration, providing insights and recommendations based on user-uploaded CSV files. The assistant leverages natural language processing models, including Google's Language Model (GooglePalm), to interactively assist users in their data science journey.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The application facilitates EDA by analyzing and summarizing the user's dataset. It covers data cleaning, summarization, correlation analysis, outlier detection, and feature creation.

- **ChatBox:** Users can engage with the AI Assistant in a conversational manner. The ChatBox allows users to ask questions, seek insights about specific variables, and receive recommendations for algorithms suitable for their business problems.
